  # Which dirs to skip: issues from them won't be reported.
  # Can use regexp here: `generated.*`, regexp is applied on full path,
  # including the path prefix if one is set.
  # Default value is empty list,
  # but default dirs are skipped independently of this option's value (see skip-dirs-use-default).
  # "/" will be replaced by current OS file path separator to properly work on Windows.

  # If set we pass it to "go list -mod={option}". From "go help modules":
  # If invoked with -mod=readonly, the go command is disallowed from the implicit
  # automatic updating of go.mod described above. Instead, it fails when any changes
  # to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check that go.mod does
  # not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
  # If invoked with -mod=vendor, the go command assumes that the vendor
  # directory holds the correct copies of dependencies and ignores
  # the dependency descriptions in go.mod.
  #
  # Allowed values: readonly|vendor|mod
  # By default, it isn't set.

  # Define the Go version limit.
  # Mainly related to generics support since go1.18.
